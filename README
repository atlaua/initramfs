This is a simple initramfs for a LVM on cryptsetup/LUKS setup.

It uses /bin/busybox and obviously /sbin/cryptsetup and /sbin/lvm. The Makefile additionally
requires the lddtree utility from pax-utils.

## Usage

* Adjust the vars file. It should contain something like

    LUKS_UUID=9221b894-b7c0-4371-9e42-7a6665031461
    ROOTFS=ext4

* $ make

* $ cp initramfs.img /boot

For customization, you can edit the init script init.in. The list of files contained in the
initramfs is controlled by list.in and the variables on the top of the Makefile.
